The Curses Perl module was created by William Setzer (William_Setzer at
ncsu.edu) in 1994.  William maintained it up until July 2001, when he stopped
having time to do so.

In September 2004, Bryan Henderson (bryanh@giraffe-data.com) took over
maintainership of it, after confirming with William that he did not plan to
continue.

The module has always been distributed via CPAN.

Curses itself is much older than the Perl implementation.  Curses was
originally only a C programming library.

See the file ChangeLog for the list of changes in each release.
